Docs structure

Purpose: This file describes the intended organization and purpose of files in the `docs/` folder.

Organization:

- README.md — Entry point and quick index
- DEVELOPER_KEY.md — Developer key and CI guide
- FIT_ANOMALY_DETECTION.md — Technical deep dive for FIT anomaly detection
- SIMULATOR_TIME_SKIP_TESTING.md — Simulator test scenarios
- TIME_SKIP_FIX.md — Implementation notes for time-skip handling
- DEBUG_ANALYSIS.md — Debugging and validation utilities
- CHANGES_SUMMARY.md — Summarized changelog
- EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md / README_FIT_ANOMALY_DETECTION.txt — Stakeholder-facing summaries
- GVM_MAXIMIZER_PATTERN.md — Reusable design patterns extracted during development

Guidelines for future docs:

- Keep documents focused (1 topic per file)
- Avoid duplication — cross-reference existing docs instead of repeating content
- Keep examples copy-paste ready (runnable snippets)
- Use README.md as the single index entry for users
